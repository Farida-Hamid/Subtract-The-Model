For this project, the user will upload an image of a person and chose whether they want one-to-all clothing items or the whole person subtracted from the image.

### Day 1:
I chose the [clothing-co-parsing](https://github.com/bearpaw/clothing-co-parsing) dataset to build a background subtraction model. Â The dataset is downloaded and masking images are visualized.

### Day 2:
It turns out that the masked are only 1004 while all images are 2098. I was hoping to rely only on making images. Clearly, I can't.
